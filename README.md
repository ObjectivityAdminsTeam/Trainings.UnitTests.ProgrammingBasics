In this repository you will find material for second part of unit tests training. Provided materials will cover topics concerning introduction to unit tests development. For this purpose we will be using [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) framework and [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4). Together with that you will also find short introduction to other test frameworks ([nUnit](https://www.nunit.org/) and [MS Test](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh598960.aspx)), [NSubstitute](http://nsubstitute.github.io/) and tools that calculate test coverage. Moreover you will gain practical knowledge how to run and debug unit tests. I hope that after this training you will be able to start writing simple unit tests.

Go to the first part of training: [Unit tests I intro](https://github.com/ObjectivityBSS/Trainings.UnitTests.Introduction).

This training has been prepared especially for testers but I believe that other groups will find also useful information.
